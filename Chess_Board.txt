rook => hathi 
=>The Pawn
When a game begins, each side starts with eight pawns. White's pawns are located on the 
second rank, while Black's pawns are located on the seventh rank.

=>The Bishop
->Each side starts with two bishops, one on a light square and one on a dark square.  When 
a game begins, White's bishops are located on c1 and f1, while Black's bishops are located 
on c8 and f8.
->The bishop is considered a minor piece (like a knight) and is worth three points. A bishop 
can move diagonally as many squares as it likes, as long as it is not blocked by its own 
pieces or an occupied square. An easy way to remember how a bishop can move is that it moves 
like an "X" shape. It can capture an enemy piece by moving to the occupied square where the 
piece is located. 

=>The Knight
->Each side starts with two knights—a king's knight and a queen's knight. When a game starts, 
White's knights are located on b1 and g1, while Black's knights are located on b8 and g8.
->The knight is considered a minor piece (like a bishop) and is worth three points. The knight 
is the only piece in chess that can jump over another piece! It moves one square left or right 
horizontally and then two squares up or down vertically, OR it moves two squares left or right 
horizontally and then one square up or down vertically—in other words, the knight moves in
 an "L-shape." The knight can capture only what it lands on, not what it jumps over!

=>The Rook
->Each side starts with two rooks, one on the queenside and one on the kingside. All four rooks 
are located in the corners of the board. White's rooks start the game on a1 and h1, while 
Black's rooks are located on a8 and h8.
->The rook is considered a major piece (like the queen) and is worth five points. It can move 
as many squares as it likes left or right horizontally, or as many squares as it likes up or 
down vertically (as long as it isn't blocked by other pieces). An easy way to remember how a 
rook can move is that it moves like a "+" sign.

The Queen
The queen is the most powerful chess piece! When a game begins, each side starts with one queen. 
The white queen is located on d1, while the black queen is located on d8.
The queen is considered a major piece (like a rook) and is worth nine points. It can move as 
many squares as it likes left or right horizontally, or as many squares as it likes up or down 
vertically (like a rook). The queen can also move as many squares as it likes diagonally 
(like a bishop). An easy way to remember how a queen can move is that it moves like a rook 
and a bishop combined! 

condition of diagonal
   (r1-r2) == (c1-c2)
   OR  (r1-r2) == (c2-c1)  

combining above two equations we get 
   abs(r1-r2) == abs(c1-c2)

condition of having in same row or column
   r1-r2 == 0 || c1-c2 == 0

minimum moves to reache  a point 
  min(abs(r1-r2) , abs(c1-c2)) + remaining after removing min value 
  means 
  max(abs(r1-r2) , abs(c1-c2))

condition of having in different colour cells 
  parity of abs(r1-r2) != abs(c1-c2);
  means abs(r1-r2) %2 != abs(c1-c2) % 2

  in more simple language we can say that (abs(r1-r2) + abs(c1-c2)) %  2 == 1
  means addition of ***same parity elements will always be even*** thus checking only this will fulfill 
  all the requirement but this may cause ***integer overflow
