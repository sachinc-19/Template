The expected value (EV) is an anticipated value for an investment at some point in the future. In statistics and 
probability analysis, the expected value is calculated by multiplying each of the possible outcomes by the likelihood 
each outcome will occur and then summing all of those values.

EV = ∑ P(Xi) × Xi
