//**************** Segment tree GCD — Range Update & Range Query ***********//

Today I realized that I cannot implement GCD segment tree with range update & range query, the same way I did for min/max/sum segtree with range update & range query. Now I wonder is it possible to write this kind of segment tree with O(logN) complexity for each operation? Operations:

Add some number x to range [l, r]
Find GCD of range [l, r]
P.S. not to be confused with:

Initialize each number in range [l, r] to x
Find GCD of range [l, r]

Store two segment trees: one for adding some number to range and taking value of element (usual segment tree
with lazy propagation) and one based on differences of adjacent elements. When you add a number to the range, 
only two values in second segment tree change, so you can easily recalculate values in second tree.

Now use the property that gcd(al, al + 1, ..., ar) = gcd(al, al + 1 - al, al + 2 - al + 1, ..., ar - ar - 1).

So basically what we are doing is that we are doing the change operations on 1st segment tree lazily and then 
querying the first and last element of the range needed. we use this with the middle values from segment tree 
of consecutive difference which never changes for the given update property. Very nice approach, building a 
segment tree that doesn't depend on the update at all!!
